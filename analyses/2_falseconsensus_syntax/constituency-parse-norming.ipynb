    "# Norming psycholingusitic stimulus text with neural sentence parsers\n",
    "## Brandon Waldon - Draft 08/08/2023\n",
    "### Motivation \n",
    "Pyscholinguistic research frequently involves experiment designs in which the manipulation of interest is syntactic in nature. In such cases, it is crucial that stimuli faithfully reflect the syntactic constructs of interest, and that they do so in a consistent manner. Verifying these correspondences **exclusively** by hand -- especially when the manipulations of interest are subtle or when an experiment features many items -- can easily give way to human error. Though researchers should of course always check their stimuli by hand, the premise of this norming exercise is that machine-assited verification can help to reduce human error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural constituency parsers are neural network-based models which take as their input strings of natural language text and which output parse trees that reflect the input text's phrase structure. These models tend to vastly outperform their non-neural predecessors for well-resourced languages such as English. As I'll demonstrate below, when the phrase structure schema employed by the model has correspondences with the constructs of interest in one's psycholinguistic study, constituency parsing can be a useful additional 'check' on manually-designed stimuli."

    "### Methods\n",
    "To norm stimuli associated with this study, I'll use the Stanza library (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) to constituency parse the policy wording associated with each stimulus. Each item in the study occurs in one of four possible configurations corresponding to two manipulations:\n",
    "- Presence of center-embedded relative clause [yes/no]: in the `yes` condition, policy wording is written as a single sentence, and the matrix NP is modified by a relative clause which intervenes between the matrix NP and matrix VP, creating a long-distance dependency between the matrix NP (always *An incident...*) and matrix VP (always *... results in...*). In the `no` condition, policy wording is written as two sentences: in the first sentence, the corresponding `yes`-condition sentence's relative clause is expressed as a main clause; in the second sentence, the matrix VP is just the matrix VP of the corresponding `yes`-condition sentence, and the matrix NP (*This incident...*) co-refers with the matrix NP of the first sentence (*An incident...*).\n",
    "- Presence of passive voice [yes/no]: the `yes` condition features passive voice, as expressed via auxiliary BE + past participle + *by*-PP (e.g. *is leaked by a fixed heating installation*). The `no` condition features active voice (e.g. *a fixed heating installation leaks*). \n",
    "Our goal will be to confirm that the stimuli in our study do, in fact, meet these criteria, as well as some additional criteria designed to enforce additional normalization across item sets. To visualize the dependency parses, I'll use NLTK, which includes a `TreeView` method for saving phrase structure trees as images. "

In the following blocks of code, we create the pipeline, run our policy wording through it, and save the resulting parse trees as .png files which we can then manually review.  "
